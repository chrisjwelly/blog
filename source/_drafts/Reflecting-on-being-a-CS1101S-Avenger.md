## Introduction
In NUS, CS1101S Programming Methodology is the introductory course to programming for CS Freshmen. It uses the SICP textbook, which is adapted to JavaScript (just today, it was actually announced that the adaptation is going public!). The course itself is actually taught by using a subset of JavaScript called Source, written and developed by the teaching team together with some students. I am aware that there are many undesirable things in JS, and Source aims to mitigate that by "providing the good parts". That way, freshmen can still learn fundamentals of programming without having to learn the intricacies of the actual JS. 

The module has been taught by Assoc Prof Martin Henz and Dr Low Kok Lim for several years now. Traditionally, it used to be an optional 5-MC module, slightly more credits compared to a standard 4-MC module. As of AY18/19 (the year I matriculated), it became a compulsory 4-MC module for CS freshmen. 

Avenger is a term used in the module to refer to the tutors, usually undergraduates. A tutorial<sup>1</sup> class in CS1101S usually comprises of 6 to 8 students (only!), and led by an Avenger which serves the role of facilitating discussions. Perhaps they are best described as 'Discussion Group Facilitators'. But hey, that's a mouthful, and an 'Avenger' does sound way cooler!

In AY19/20 Sem 1, I took up the role of an Avenger. I led a discussion group of 6 students (initially it was supposed to be 8 but there was some reshuffling around). It's been a super busy semester, and I would like to share my experience on being one. If you are a student contemplating on whether to apply on being an Avenger, hope this post can help provide you with some insights!

Actually, during the holiday break prior to the sem, I also worked as an Avenger for SWS3012, which is a 2-week Summer Workshop for visitng international students, taught with condensed CS1101S material. Due to this exposure, Prof Martin asked if I was willing to be an "Avenger Mentor" to mentor the new Avengers once the sem took a full swing. I took up this role. I will briefly talk about these 2 experiences as well.

This post will *not* be a review of the module, but rather a reflection on my experience as an Avenger. I may include some thoughts on the module, though.

## Motivation
Let's start by talking about why I decided to take up the role.

I actually came into CS with barely any background. As I was taking the module, I was rather so-so at first. I could grasp the basics of recursion (which is pretty central to the module), but could not solve the advanced problems easily. It was only closer to midterms when I was attending Eldric's (a graduate teaching assistant) remedial session on trees that I felt everything suddenly clicked. I realised how powerful the concept of "Wishful Thinking" was, and I would say that my skills improved quite significantly since. 

The module is by no means easy, and throughout the module I would discuss numerous things with friends. I would get questions, and explain them as best as I can. Over time, several of my friends reaffirmed my ability in teaching and started saying that I should be an Avenger. I laughed off the idea at first because I didn't think I was ready to take such an important role, but all the support I received really really started encouraging me. My own Avenger Hieu also recommended me, which truly gave me the push I needed. Closer to the end of the semester, I was determined to be an Avenger. 

I do really enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge with others. In a previous online game I played (Dragon Nest SEA), I used to write a guide for a particular game character. It brings me so much joy whenever I managed to bring someone closer to understanding. It's just that I was unsure whether I have what it takes to take up this role. So, all the encouragements I received played a huge part in my decision. Thank you everyone, for encouraging me!

Come the next semester, I applied and prepared hard for the interview. Truthfully, it felt like it was such a long time since I wanted something really badly. I practised teaching using a whiteboard so hard, that I actually strained my arm a few days before my interview! I was pretty worried, but fortunately the interview went well. I'm not sure how much I can share about the interview process, but if you are applying to be an Avenger and reading this: I think it is reasonable that in an interview for teaching, you are expected to teach something.

Spoiler alert, I was offered the role! I was really thrilled, and looked forward to the experience!

## SWS3012 and being Avenger Mentor
Proceeding chronologically, what happened next was SWS3012. I happened to be relatively free during the summer period, and I thought that before going full-swing into teaching in the semester, why not give myself an exposure to teaching?

Honestly, it was quite challenging in terms of communication. The visiting students had a decent command of the English language. However, Programming can get very technical, and I always had doubts whether what I wanted to convey went through. I think the experience reminded me to be patient when I teach.

There was also another student under me who was lagging in the summer workshop module, and he struggled in understanding his assignments. I tried helping him go through his work, but it didn't seem to work well. Another Avenger also helped me out, but his approach was different: instead of going through the assignment, he went through very simple examples. It's such a simple approach, but I overlooked it. I was too focused on helping him finish his work, that I didn't think of going through the entire concept from scratch. I was reminded that I should seek for long-term rather than short-term goals when presented the opportunity.

It was short, but nevertheless a fruitful experience. Although the summer and actual module styles are different, I felt slightly more prepared to teach properly in the semester.

As mentioned before, I was also offered to be an Avenger Mentor, which is supposed to coach other "new" Avengers. I accepted the role, but I always felt it was weird for me to being in the position. I took the module together as classmates with the Avengers I am leading, so to say that I am "mentoring" them is a little strange. 

That being said, I took the role of "leading" seriously. I ensured that I would answer the questions whenever I am capable, took initiative in things like writing meeting minutes, facilitated the discussion between fellow Avengers in my cluster, etc. 

Thinking more deeply about this, I think what I went through is reflective of the working world: a team of Software Engineers may consist of members who are more knowledgeable than the one leading them, and that's all right. What would matter was whether the leader could bring the best out of the members to achieve the same goal.

I am grateful to have been given this opportunity to lead. There was no form of official feedback given to Avenger Mentors, but I know I had tried my best and I can only hope that the Avengers in my cluster had a pleasant experience.

## The Avenger work in the semester

This should be the bulk of the reflection, yet I wrote so much already! Thank you for reading up to this point.

After everything that I have gone through, I generally had some goals I wanted to achieve when being an Avenger (and in no particular order):
* Value-add my students' understanding in the subject material
* Ensure that my students grasp the concept of recursion early
* Reinforce my understanding of the CS1101S material

### Value-adding
I think the first point should naturally be the goal of every Avenger. While I did not explicitly plan this out, I realise that I subconsiously took a two-pronged approach:
1. Material preparation
2. Interaction in tutorials and consultations

#### 1. Material Preparation
Material preparation for me was mostly done in the form of slides. For current CS1101S students, I provide my materials this semester [here](tinyurl.com/cs1101s-1920-christian). Back when I was a student, my recitation teaching assistant Jin (we have 2 forms of "tutorials", but I shall not go to details), prepared very detailed and helpful slides. I was very much inspired by him to do the same for my students. I e-mailed him back when I was teaching SWS3012, and he kindly provided a detailed guideline to how he prepared his slides. I can't thank him enough for that! It became some sort of reference for me, and I did use some of his old slides for my content.

I prepared my slides with some things in mind:
* I want the slides to be mostly self-sufficient. Meaning, the students can refer to it without me needing to explain what I meant.
* It should provide a deeper understanding of the module content
* It needs some memes peppered for the lulz

Slides being self-sufficient is motivated by protecting my time and urgency. I hope that my slides can answer some questions students may have, without needing to ask me. Of course, I don't mind questions, but me being a student too means that I need some time for my own studies as well. Urgency works both ways, what if a student urgently needs some answers (30 mins before exams?), and I cannot answer readily? Or what if I can, but lack some proper material to do so? 

For deeper understanding, I try to share some tips and tricks to tackle certain things. For example, a Binary Search Tree can be easily verified if you were to "drop" all the nodes and check whether they are all in-order (i.e. perform an inorder traversal and check if the number appears sorted). Another thing I like to do is to provide visualisation, because I feel that it will improve understanding. 

Lastly, memes. Heavily inspired by my tutor Jin as well. But also because I want the slides to be more light-hearted. I either find memes online, or adapt CS1101S-related things to a specific meme format. Here are some examples I created (which require you to be a student/avenger this sem I think):

<Insert memes>

Usually I release my slides at the end of my class, and share them to CS1101S students outside my class as well. Sharing is caring~

I personally feel that I have done a good job in maintaining the slides. In particular, I was really proud of my [Meta-Circular Evaluator slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NiGmkv17_QFGdOKpPZsfh08fBc2I4wos8WPSsJ0u0d0/edit#slide=id.g6fb76fb4b8_0_0). MCE is known to be a very hard-to-grasp topic, and I spared no effort in ensuring I can explain it well in my slides. What really thrilled me was that at some point, it reached 10 viewers simultaneously:

<Insert 10 people viewing here>

While in a cohort-level that's not a lot, but 10 people is more than the students I have! That was a personal satisfaction for me that people are using my slides.

If you look through my slides, I put a lot and a lot of effort in preparing it. I tend to prepare it on my long bus rides, and when I am unproductive in my own studies. For some slides like Environment Model and Meta-Circular Evaluator, I stayed up later than my usual sleep time to prepare them. Honestly, it started becoming an addiction! It also serves for me to ensure that I understand the material enough. In the end, it was pretty satisfying though as I think some students benefitted from it. I received this message from a student outside my class, which really really really made me happy:

<Insert thank you message for slides here>

One thing that I consciously tried to avoid was adding my answers to my slides. I want students to think for the solutions themselves, and I purposely omitted the answers to tutorial questions. However, what I eventually started doing was to add students' answers. I think that having gone through the tutorial, students deserve to learn from the answers that the peers have come up with. I feel that students ought to take notes of discussions happening in class, and what I tried to do was to bring it up further since I can provide comments and remarks. I hope that my students did not become lazy in note-taking or stopped listening to the peers because of this, though. On hindsight, I should have asked how they felt about this! 

By providing so much, I constantly wondered whether I am spoon-feeding them. It's hard to thread a fine balance between helping just enough, and spoon-feeding. I argued with myself that CS1101S is an introductory module. Students new to programming are likely to require more help. Then I argued back that they should get used to being independent early. Eventually, I gave in to the former argument. I think there's ample opportunity for them to be independent in their learning. I value that I am able to provide them with a good foundation instead. I do try to strike a balance when I can; I leave some thinking questions in my slides instead of providing everything. 

If I were to teach another module, I am not sure how much effort I will be putting into my slides. What I know is that I will likely be preparing something supplementary for students to refer to. Perhaps, I will then revisit the earlier arguments about helping and being independent.

#### 2. Interaction in tutorials and consultations
When I was a student, my Avenger conducted the tutorial in a way that we begin by refreshing some concepts, followed by discussion among students, then presentation of answer by students. I adopted this style for my own class. All of this is to be done within around 1 hour 35 minutes, because tutorial slots are 2 hours long.

With the help of my slides, I would be doing some form of revision with my students. This usually should not take more than 30 minutes, unless the topic is really packed. Then, I will let them break into pairs for discussions, giving them around another 30 minutes or so. I would walk around to follow their discussion, and answer questions which they may have. Finally, I would give them the opportunity to present their answers.
