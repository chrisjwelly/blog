## Introduction
In NUS, CS1101S Programming Methodology is the introductory course to programming for CS Freshmen. It uses the SICP textbook, which is adapted to JavaScript (just today, it was actually announced that the adaptation is going public!). The course itself is actually taught by using a subset of JavaScript called Source, written and developed by the teaching team together with some students. I am aware that there are many undesirable things in JS, and Source aims to mitigate that by "providing the good parts". That way, freshmen can still learn fundamentals of programming without having to learn the intricacies of the actual JS. 

The module has been taught by Assoc Prof Martin Henz and Dr Low Kok Lim for several years now. Traditionally, it used to be an optional 5-MC module, slightly more credits compared to a standard 4-MC module. As of AY18/19 (the year I matriculated), it became a compulsory 4-MC module for CS freshmen. 

Avenger is a term used in the module to refer to the tutors, usually undergraduates. A tutorial class in CS1101S usually comprises of 6 to 8 students (only!), and led by an Avenger which serves the role of facilitating discussions. Perhaps they are best described as 'Discussion Group Facilitators'. But hey, that's a mouthful, and an 'Avenger' does sound way cooler!

In AY19/20 Sem 1, I took up the role of an Avenger. I led a discussion group of 6 students (initially it was supposed to be 8 but there was some reshuffling around). It's been a super busy semester, and I would like to share my experience on being one. If you are a student contemplating on whether to apply on being an Avenger, hope this post can help provide you with some insights!

Actually, during the holiday break prior to the sem, I also worked as an Avenger for SWS3012, which is a 2-week Summer Workshop for visitng international students, taught with condensed CS1101S material. Due to this exposure, Prof Martin asked if I was willing to be an "Avenger Mentor" to mentor the new Avengers once the sem took a full swing. I took up this role. I will briefly talk about these 2 experiences as well.

This post will *not* be a review of the module, but rather a reflection on my experience as an Avenger. I may include some thoughts on the module, though.

## Motivation
Let's start by talking about why I decided to take up the role.

I actually came into CS with barely any background. As I was taking the module, I was rather so-so at first. I could grasp the basics of recursion (which is pretty central to the module), but could not solve the advanced problems easily. It was only closer to midterms when I was attending Eldric's (a graduate teaching assistant) remedial session on trees that I felt everything suddenly clicked. I realised how powerful the concept of "Wishful Thinking" was, and I would say that my skills improved quite significantly since. 

The module is by no means easy, and throughout the module I would discuss numerous things with friends. I would get questions, and explain them as best as I can. Over time, several of my friends reaffirmed my ability in teaching and started saying that I should be an Avenger. I laughed off the idea at first because I didn't think I was ready to take such an important role, but all the support I received really really started encouraging me. My own Avenger Hieu also recommended me, which truly gave me the push I needed. Closer to the end of the semester, I was determined to be an Avenger. 

I do really enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge with others. In a previous online game I played (Dragon Nest SEA), I used to write a guide for a particular game character. It brings me so much joy whenever I managed to bring someone closer to understanding. It's just that I was unsure whether I have what it takes to take up this role. So, all the encouragements I received played a huge part in my decision. Thank you everyone, for encouraging me!

Come the next semester, I applied and prepared hard for the interview. Truthfully, it felt like it was such a long time since I wanted something really badly. I practised teaching using a whiteboard so hard, that I actually strained my arm a few days before my interview! I was pretty worried, but fortunately the interview went well. I'm not sure how much I can share about the interview process, but if you are applying to be an Avenger and reading this: I think it is reasonable that in an interview for teaching, you are expected to teach something.

Spoiler alert, I was offered the role! I was really thrilled, and looked forward to the experience!

## SWS3012 and being Avenger Mentor
Proceeding chronologically, what happened next was SWS3012. I happened to be relatively free during the summer period, and I thought that before going full-swing into teaching in the semester, why not give myself an exposure to teaching?

Honestly, it was quite challenging in terms of communication. The visiting students are from China, and they had a decent command of the English language. However, Programming can get very technical, and I always had doubts whether what I wanted to convey went through. I think the experience reminded me to be patient when I teach.

There was also another student under me who was lagging in the summer workshop module, and he struggled in understanding his assignments. I tried helping him go through his work, but it didn't seem to work well. Another Avenger also helped me out, but his approach was different: instead of going through the assignment, he went through very simple examples. It's such a simple approach, but I overlooked it. I was too focused on helping him finish his work, that I didn't think of going through the entire concept from scratch. I was reminded that I should seek for long-term rather than short-term goals when presented the opportunity.

It was short, but nevertheless a fruitful experience. Although the summer and actual module styles are different, I felt slightly more prepared to teach properly in the semester.

As mentioned before, I was also offered to be an Avenger Mentor, which is supposed to coach other "new" Avengers. I accepted the role, but I always felt it was weird for me to being in the position. I took the module together as classmates with the Avengers I am leading, so to say that I am "mentoring" them is a little strange. 

That being said, I took the role of "leading" seriously. I ensured that I would answer the questions whenever I am capable, took initiative in things like writing meeting minutes, facilitated the discussion between fellow Avengers in my cluster, etc. 

Thinking more deeply about this, I think what I went through is reflective of the working world: a team of Software Engineers may consist of members who are more knowledgeable than the one leading them, and that's all right. What would matter was whether the leader could bring the best out of the members to achieve the same goal.

I am grateful to have been given this opportunity to lead. There was no form of official feedback given to Avenger Mentors, but I know I had tried my best and I can only hope that the Avengers in my cluster had a pleasant experience.
